# Voice Processing and Cloning Project Plan

## Project Overview
This project will provide a class-based solution for:
1. Processing MP3 files to:
   - Convert voice recordings to text
   - Clone voices using ElevenLabs
2. Using cloned voices to generate speech from text

## Core Components

### VoiceProcessor Class
- Handle MP3 file input
- Convert speech to text
- Interface with ElevenLabs for voice cloning
- Generate speech using cloned voices

### Dependencies
- ElevenLabs API for TTS and voice cloning
- Speech recognition library (e.g., Whisper) for speech-to-text
- File handling for MP3 processing

## Implementation Steps
1. Create VoiceProcessor class structure
2. Implement speech-to-text functionality
3. Add voice cloning capabilities
4. Develop text-to-speech with cloned voices
5. Create a simple CLI interface

## Future Enhancements
- Web interface
- Batch processing
- Voice profile management
- Integration with other LLM services
