# AI Voice Agent Project Plan

## Overview
Create a system where users can record voice responses to questions, have their voice cloned, and create an AI agent that speaks as them to visitors.

## System Components

### 1. User Onboarding Flow
- **Question Set**: Define standard questions to gather personal/professional information
- **Voice Recording**: Capture high-quality audio samples for voice cloning
- **Profile Creation**: Store user information and voice ID

### 2. Voice Processing Pipeline
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribe user recordings to extract information
- **Voice Cloning**: Create voice clone using ElevenLabs
- **Audio Optimization**: Ensure recordings meet quality requirements

### 3. Agent Creation & Management
- **User Profile Database**: Store user information, preferences, and voice IDs
- **Response Generation**: Use LLM (Claude) to generate contextual responses
- **Voice Synthesis**: Convert text responses to speech using cloned voice

### 4. Visitor Interface
- **Agent Selection**: Allow visitors to choose which user's agent to interact with
- **Conversation UI**: Provide interface for text/voice interaction
- **Session Management**: Track conversation history and context

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Voice Processing
- [x] Implement speech-to-text functionality (using OpenAI Whisper)
- [x] Implement voice cloning (using ElevenLabs)
- [x] Implement text-to-speech with cloned voices
- [x] Create audio optimization tools

### Phase 2: User Onboarding
- [ ] Design question set for user profiles
- [ ] Create recording interface/workflow
- [ ] Implement profile creation and storage
- [ ] Build voice processing pipeline

### Phase 3: Agent System
- [ ] Design agent architecture and response generation
- [ ] Implement context management
- [ ] Connect to LLM for response generation
- [ ] Integrate voice synthesis

### Phase 4: Visitor Experience
- [ ] Create agent selection interface
- [ ] Build conversation UI
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add analytics and feedback mechanisms
