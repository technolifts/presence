# AI Voice Agent Project Plan

## Overview
Create a system where users can record voice responses to questions, have their voice cloned, and create an AI agent that speaks as them to visitors.

## System Components

### 1. User Onboarding Flow
- **Question Set**: Define standard questions to gather personal/professional information
- **Voice Recording**: Capture high-quality audio samples for voice cloning
- **Profile Creation**: Store user information and voice ID

### 2. Voice Processing Pipeline
- **Speech-to-Text**: Transcribe user recordings to extract information
- **Voice Cloning**: Create voice clone using ElevenLabs
- **Audio Optimization**: Ensure recordings meet quality requirements

### 3. Agent Creation & Management
- **User Profile Database**: Store user information, preferences, and voice IDs
- **Response Generation**: Use LLM (Claude) to generate contextual responses
- **Voice Synthesis**: Convert text responses to speech using cloned voice

### 4. Visitor Interface
- **Agent Selection**: Allow visitors to choose which user's agent to interact with
- **Conversation UI**: Provide interface for text/voice interaction
- **Session Management**: Track conversation history and context

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Voice Processing
- [x] Implement speech-to-text functionality (using OpenAI Whisper)
- [x] Implement voice cloning (using ElevenLabs)
- [x] Implement text-to-speech with cloned voices
- [x] Create audio optimization tools

### Phase 2: User Onboarding
- [ ] Design question set for user profiles
- [ ] Create recording interface/workflow
- [ ] Implement profile creation and storage
- [ ] Build voice processing pipeline

### Phase 3: Agent System
- [ ] Design agent architecture and response generation
- [ ] Implement context management
- [ ] Connect to LLM for response generation
- [ ] Integrate voice synthesis

### Phase 4: Visitor Experience
- [ ] Create agent selection interface
- [ ] Build conversation UI
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add analytics and feedback mechanisms

## Technical Components

### APIs & Services
- **ElevenLabs**: Voice cloning and text-to-speech
- **OpenAI**: Speech-to-text transcription
- **Anthropic Claude**: Response generation

### Data Storage
- User profiles
- Voice IDs and samples
- Conversation histories

### User Experience
- Recording interface
- Agent interaction interface
- Profile management

## API Implementation Plan

### Voice Processing API
We need to expose our voice processing functionality as API endpoints to support the web application:

#### API Endpoints
- **POST /api/transcribe**: Transcribe audio to text
  - Input: Audio file
  - Output: Transcribed text

- **POST /api/voices/clone**: Clone a voice
  - Input: Audio file, voice name, description
  - Output: Voice ID

- **POST /api/tts**: Generate speech from text
  - Input: Text, voice ID
  - Output: Audio file

- **POST /api/optimize-audio**: Optimize audio for voice cloning
  - Input: Audio file, duration
  - Output: Optimized audio file

- **GET /api/voices**: List available voices
  - Output: List of voice IDs and names

#### Implementation Approach
1. Create a Flask/FastAPI application to expose the VoiceProcessor functionality
2. Add proper error handling and validation
3. Implement file upload handling for audio files
4. Add authentication and rate limiting
5. Create Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

#### Security Considerations
- API key authentication
- File size and type validation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure storage of API keys and user data

## Flask UI Implementation

### User Interface
We've created a simple Flask web application that provides:
- A voice recording interface with visualization
- Voice cloning functionality
- Text-to-speech testing with the cloned voice

### Components
- **Flask Web App**: Serves the UI and communicates with the API
- **Recording Interface**: Uses the MediaRecorder API to capture audio
- **Audio Visualization**: Displays a waveform of the recording
- **Voice Cloning Form**: Submits the recording to create a voice clone
- **Text-to-Speech Testing**: Tests the cloned voice with custom text

### Architecture
1. The Flask app serves as a client to the Voice Processing API
2. Audio recording happens in the browser using JavaScript
3. The recorded audio is sent to the API for voice cloning
4. The cloned voice ID is stored in the session
5. Text-to-speech requests use the cloned voice ID
